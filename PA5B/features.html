               <p>- I implemented 4 types of light. It is visible but faint because I put in a fog effect. There are orbital controls. The skybox is also there but is set to the same color as the fog to creaate a misty/foggy forest atmosphere. Theres more than 20 primary shapes but those are also hard to see because of the fog. The cylinders and cones were used to make trees for the forest. </p>
