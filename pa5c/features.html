            <h2>Notes to Grader</h2>
            
               <p>- I added a playable/movable character you can move with WASD and toggle run/walk mode with shift key. The model and animation files are from the Three.js installed files section (it comes with the Three.js)</p>
               <p>- I added collision detection and Tree and character bounding boxes so the character cannot go through trees. I also made it so that once the character hits the tree, it can then slide around the edges of the tree's bounding box</p>
               <p>- The trees randomly generate every time you reload the page</p>
               <p>- Orbital controls are bound to character. You can zoom in/out and change angle around character by normal orbital control gestures.</p>
               <p>- I added a custom fog shader. The fog density pulses very lightly</p>
