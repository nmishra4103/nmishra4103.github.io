               <p>WASD are the Forward, Backward, Left, Right commands. Q and E are for panLeft and panRight. X is for move up and Z is for move Down. N is for adding blocks and M is for removing blocks. Please press the Minecraft Mode button before attempting to add or remove blocks so you can see it properly. The story for this scene is that you are Decepticon Soundwave and you sent one of your cassettes, Ravage, to scout for energon. Ravage comm’d you that he found some but he’s too small to get up there. The WOW feature is that you can change the texture of the skybox from the dropdown menu. </p>
